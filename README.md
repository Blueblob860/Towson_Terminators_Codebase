Robotics code created by the THS Robotics Team.

The code file is the one with .v5code You must open it with the VEXcode Pro V5 App for it to work. It can be downloaded here: https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5 Make sure to get the "VEXcode Pro V5" not the "VEX code V5 (Blocks and Text)"
