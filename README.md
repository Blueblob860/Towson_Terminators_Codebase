# Towson_Terminators_Codebase
Robotics code created by Leo Abubucker as the Programmer of the THS Robotics Team (2021 - Present).

**A note about 2021-2022 code:**

2021-2022 code was written in the now deprecated VEXcode Pro V5 application and can be either read in the app (if still available) or imported via the GUI available in the VEX Robotics extension in VScode. Download link for the VEXcode Pro V5 application (if still available): https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5. Make sure to get the "VEXcode Pro V5" not the "VEXcode V5 (Blocks and Text)."

**Notes on the Directory Structure:**

The "Competitive_Code" folder contains all code actually used at VEX VRC competitions by the Towson Terminators, sorted by season.

The "Non-Competitve_Code" folder contains all code that was either never intended for or ultimately never used in actual competitions, sorted by season.
