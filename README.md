# Towson Terminators Codebase
 - C++ robotics code that was created by the Towson Robotics Team from the years 2021-Present.
 - A Python GUI application for attendance logging. 

## Usage 
This codebase has been licensed with an MIT license to allow and promote free and open access to code that is necessary or useful for VEX VRC teams. 
This codebase has been created primarily for the following reasons:
1. To allow our documenters to readily incorporate code into engineering notebooks.
2. To serve as guidance for future programmers on our team and maybe beyond.
3. To serve as a historical record of our team's C++ programming.

As per the MIT License, all/any part(s) of this codebase may be forked and modified for use. Please read the notes on directory structure and 2021-2022 code below for guidance and a video tutorial that provides details on using/modifying this codebase will be coming soon. We hope this codebase helps guide you on your programming journey! 

## Directory Structure
 - The "Attendance_Tracker" folder contains a standalone Python application that is used to track attendance for meetings. More details can be found in the "AttendanceTracker_README.md" file in the folder. 
 - The "Competitive_Code" folder contains all code actually used at VEX VRC competitions by the Towson Terminators, sorted by season.
 - The "Non-Competitve_Code" folder contains all code that was either never intended for or ultimately never used in actual competitions, sorted by season. 
 - All C++ header (.h) files can be found in any folders titled "include"
 - All C++ source (.cpp) files can be found in any folders titled "src"
 - C++ Code execution always starts in the main.cpp file. 

## A Note About 2021-2022 Code
2021-2022 code was written in the now deprecated VEXcode Pro V5 application and can be either read in the app (if still available) or imported via the GUI available in the VEX Robotics extension in VScode. Download link for the VEXcode Pro V5 application (if still available): [VEXcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5). Make sure to get the "VEXcode Pro V5" not the "VEXcode V5 (Blocks and Text)."
