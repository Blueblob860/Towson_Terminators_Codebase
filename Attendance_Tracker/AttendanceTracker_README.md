# Attendance Tracker
A python GUI application using the customtkinter module to track and log meeting attendance. 

## Usage 
This application is licensed with the MIT license to allow a free and open source access to this software. 
1. To allow our documenters to readily incorporate code into engineering notebooks.
2. To serve as guidance for future programmers on our team and maybe beyond.
3. To serve as a historical record of our team's C++ programming.

## Directory Structure
 - The "Competitive_Code" folder contains all code actually used at VEX VRC competitions by the Towson Terminators, sorted by season.
 - The "Non-Competitve_Code" folder contains all code that was either never intended for or ultimately never used in actual competitions, sorted by season. 
 - All C++ header (.h) files can be found in any folders titled "include"
 - All C++ source (.cpp) files can be found in any folders titled "src"
 - Code execution always starts in the main.cpp file. 

## A Note About 2021-2022 Code

2021-2022 code was written in the now deprecated VEXcode Pro V5 application and can be either read in the app (if still available) or imported via the GUI available in the VEX Robotics extension in VScode. Download link for the VEXcode Pro V5 application (if still available): https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/install/v5. Make sure to get the "VEXcode Pro V5" not the "VEXcode V5 (Blocks and Text)."
