# Attendance Tracker vDEV
A python GUI application using the customtkinter module to track and log meeting attendance. 

## Usage 
- This application, as with the entire codebase, is licensed with the MIT license to allow a free and open source access to this software.
- This application has been created to have a custom way to log and monitor attendance throughout meetings.
- It utilizes sqlite databases to store user information, provides seamless clocking in and out services, and generates Excel sheets for user information and attendance log. More functionality forthcoming.

  ## Installation
- After forking, pip install the necessary dependencies (customtkinter, pillow, CTkTable, pandas, openpyxl). To run the "pip install" command, ensure that python is downloaded and in your PATH.
